##Overview##
All in all, made it to day 18 fiarly unscathed. Found it pretty hard around the 19/20th Day which was at the point where I wasn't able to complete the challenges. Next year I'll be sure to have another attempt however, I'm quite happy with how far I made it this year. Potentially in the future I will take the time to look  over some of the challenges I wasn't able to complete. Still very happy with myself, I took this as an opportunity to improve my skills with GoLang as well as to learn about datatructures I had seen in class but hadn't completely understood, both targets of which I feel have been met.
